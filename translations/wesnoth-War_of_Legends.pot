"As dictated in the Winds of Fate, the Flight of Karron and all incoming Drake flights were driven away from the Great Continent and to fly pass beyond Morogor further westerwards. This eventually led the drakes to reach the forgotten Old Continent or as the Windsong called it, Argea. The Drakes eventually settled at a new eerie constructed inside and over the volcano at the very heart of the Continent. Eventual exploration revealed that they were in the domain of the Principality of Blood, the strongest and oldest vampire clans on Irdya. Drakes and their native saurian allies did not cower and frequent clashes would result between the two factions.\n"

"The Deep Elves are descendants of the original wood-elves of the forest of Lintanir, the great grove in the northwest of the Great Continent.

At the lowest point of Blackqvasten lies the Black Lake, where a statue of Shassagoth stands. Shassagoth, often depicted as a huge black dragon, directs the Deep Elves from his shadow realm. They serve him loyally and unquestioningly, and he, in turn, smites their foes.\n"

"In the darkness of the depths, the former elves made a pact with Shassagoth and transformed. Some gained a skin as bright as the stars, a skin which could render blades and arrows harmless. These elves are called Lightborn. They retain their faerie nature, illuminating the dark caverns with their mere presence. Others evolved a skin as dark as the night, granting them shelter in the darkest realms and allowing them to merge with the shadows, quickly moving through the nights. Still others developed a skin as red as blood, reflecting the crimson liquid spilled in battle, as a sign of their remarkable powers in blade or magic. Despite their distinguishing characteristics, the pact that the Deep Elves made with Shassagoth unifies them all. And what once was elf has now become a tool of darkness.\n"
"\n"
"The followers of the depths create statues of Shassagoth throughout the vast plains of the Great Continent as monuments to expand his influence. Now, scores of statues of Shassagoth have been established, even in the most remote regions. Their stone eyes watch and wait, biding their time until the darkness once again covers the lands."

For the older lineages of their people are careful to preserve the memory of their ancestors - and nowhere is that memory better preserved than on the banners of their oldest dynasties. These are banners brought from their ancient homeland, banners under which the greatest deeds of the Aragwaithi people were achieved, and in whose threads are engraved the proofs of their old glories. Such banners may only be carried onto the battlefield by the strongest, bravest and most renowned warrior, and the sight of one of them billowing in the winds is enough to fill those rallied around it with the valour of countless generations."

And, paradoxically, it is a skill that is useless on its own; for its true value lies in those who stand by those who have it. It is, as that king goes on to say, an ability that belongs to others as much to oneself. Such lesson is one that a flagbearer learns across the years; once he fully understand it, he finds himself surrounded by those whose hearts he's earned, whose souls have been filled with his bravery, and who have learned to become greater than they are through his example.

"In an age long forgotten by the rest of the world, when the Windsong first took up their watch, they realized that it would be impractical to carry out their duty of balancing without becoming dangerously numerous themselves. The Windsong needed servants who could become numerous in times of balancing and quickly decrease in times of hiding. Servants who could be trusted utterly, could travel quickly and were able to perform a variety of tasks. The cipher, the only power used by the Windsong, was capable of carving such servants from The Raw and binding them into reality. But this required the full attention of an Ascendant to maintain even a handful of these Shards. And so the Windsong gathered the most powerful Cryptographers (those who use ciphers) to the Foundation, and had them construct an artifact of unimaginable, though very defined, power to do it for them. It took centuries to create, but with it the Windsong were finally complete.\n"

"The Steelhive is a collective race driven by the urge to expand and catalogue all existing life, and to improve its own ability to design machines based on the lifeforms it has collected. To this end, the collective has engaged in a policy of planetary conquest, assimilating the dominant organisms of the worlds they encounter and converting them into different metallic forms. The Steelhive has no leadership beyond a shared desire by the collective to catalogue more life and create more unique models based on those catalogues, and thus has no centralized weakness, behaving more like a plague than anything else.\n"

"The origin of the Steelhive is largely unknown, but the first documented appearance of the Metallizing Virus within our light cone was on the planet of Sciruss IV. The fact that the Metallizing Virus is quite clearly of engineered design rather than accidental evolution, combined with the observation that Sciruss IV had no technology capable of creating such a thing, implies that the creators of the Metallizing Virus have access to faster-than-light travel and technology quite beyond anything we know. The Steelhive is incredibly dangerous, and must be eliminated before it becomes too widespread to contain."

"The term 'vampire' is a word in an ancient dialect of the human language that would mean 'corrupted blood' in the modern tongue. In reality, vampires are not of a totally different race, but are the result of when a living creature's blood is corrupted by a very powerful, arcane type of magic. All vampires have red glowing eyes, white hair, pale skin, long fangs, and a craving for the blood of other living creatures. In addition, this magic has an effect on the creature so that it becomes similar to an undead creature; therefore necromancy, and abilities that drain will have no effect on a vampire. Some of the more powerful vampires even have the ability to transform into bats. Due to all of this, vampires are often classified as a different race.\n"
"\n"
"As vampires have a strong craving for blood, they usually overwhelm an already existing society mainly composed of living creatures, and build a monarchy or an oligarchy over it; the living members of the society would be subservient to the local vampires, and annually, five dozen of those members would be sacrificed to the vampire population. Due to this practice, the vampiric overlords encourage the subservient population to reproduce in great numbers so that the number of members of the subservient population remains plentiful. In return for compliance, the participating families get a somewhat higher place in society. These societies work for two reasons, one because of the threat the vampires present; two, the subservient members benefit from this setup.\n"

"Since blood is a very important part of vampire society, it is used as their currency. Also, blood is often involved in their magic."

msgid "Vampires always had a strong obsession with blood and control. As such, their magic typically involves blood, souls, and aura. These vampire mages attack their enemies by causing their blood to boil, or the mage will use their aura to disrupt their enemy's aura, thus being able to strike their soul. These mages' blood boiling magic works by causing the victim's aura to flare up, thus causing the victim's blood to boil. Since this magic works this way, it is able to damage the nonliving."

As the Spirit cares for her well-being above all else, it will reject the binding unless she can convince it that she is powerful enough to Ascend.
