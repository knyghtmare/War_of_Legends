"As dictated in the Winds of Fate, the Flight of Karron and all incoming Drake flights were driven away from the Great Continent and to fly pass beyond Morogor further westerwards. This eventually led the drakes to reach the forgotten Old Continent or as the Windsong called it, Argea. The Drakes eventually settled at a new eerie constructed inside and over the volcano at the very heart of the Continent. Eventual exploration revealed that they were in the domain of the Principality of Blood, the strongest and oldest vampire clans on Irdya. Drakes and their native saurian allies did not cower and frequent clashes would result between the two factions.\n"

"Fate can be treacherous at times, as quick to offer you a present as to turn it into a burden. When Meloen succeeded in brushing the knowledge of magic's origin with the tip of her mind during a short burst of supreme lucidity, she fused with her environment, against all odds. But her innate insecurity led to ever greater self-doubt and she speculated that luck only was responsible for these events, and not her determination and work. Indeed, she came to believe that misfortune toyed with her life, amusing itself by putting her in a nightmare.\n"
"Black cats are simple forest creatures that have turned into hideous chimeras through Meloen's dark thoughts. Although no one knows what kind of magic is behind their power, it seems that any creature that crosses their evil eyes is struck by misfortune."

Others evolved a skin as dark as the night, granting them shelter in the darkest realms and allowing them to merge with the shadows, quickly moving through the nights. Still others developed a skin as red as blood, reflecting the crimson liquid spilled in battle, as a sign of their remarkable powers in blade or magic. Despite their distinguishing characteristics, the pact that the Deep Elves made with Shassagoth unifies them all. And what once was elf has now become a tool of darkness.\n"

msgid "As a king of the Aragwaithi once said, the ability to earn the hearts of men, instill their souls with bravery and make them greater than they are, is one of the most sublime abilities there is. For it is not a skill that can be taught by scrolls, by tales, even by the greatest teachers; it is a skill that must be learned on its own, learned by fire and steel and experience. And, paradoxically, it is a skill that is useless on its own; for its true value lies in those who stand by those who have it. It is, as that king goes on to say, an ability that belongs to others as much to oneself. Such lesson is one that a flagbearer learns across the years; once he fully understand it, he finds himself surrounded by those whose hearts he's earned, whose souls have been filled with his bravery, and who have learned to become greater than they are through his example. With banners embroidered with tales of his own deeds and exploits, they have led the Aragwaithi from their ancient homeland and across the ages - and they will continue to do so for as long as there are winds to raise their banners high."

Wave and wave crashed against their shields, until the ground around them was muddy with gore.

Seeing their own die meaninglessly on the silver lances, the enemy forces stepped back - and that was when the Aragwaithi advanced, fighting their way through until they reached a safer area and escaped.

"In an age long forgotten by the rest of the world, when the Windsong first took up their watch, they realized that it would be impractical to carry out their duty of balancing without becoming dangerously numerous themselves. The Windsong needed servants who could become numerous in times of balancing and quickly decrease in times of hiding. Servants who could be trusted utterly, could travel quickly and were able to perform a variety of tasks. The cipher, the only power used by the Windsong, was capable of carving such servants from The Raw and binding them into reality. But this required the full attention of an Ascendant to maintain even a handful of these Shards. And so the Windsong gathered the most powerful Cryptographers (those who use ciphers) to the Foundation, and had them construct an artifact of unimaginable, though very defined, power to do it for them. It took centuries to create, but with it the Windsong were finally complete.\n"

"Shards are bound to the will of whoever controls 'The Mandate'. As they are barely present in reality, they can teleport between areas of high cipher activity (friendly towns). Also a consequence of this is their immunity to Drain, Poison and Plague. Shards are crystalline in nature and so have unusual resistances. Shards are never destroyed, they are merely 'pushed out' of reality."

"The term 'vampire' is a word in an ancient dialect of the human language that would mean 'corrupted blood' in the modern tongue. In reality, vampires are not of a totally different race, but are the result of when a living creature's blood is corrupted by a very powerful, arcane type of magic. All vampires have red glowing eyes, white hair, pale skin, long fangs, and a craving for the blood of other living creatures. In addition, this magic has an effect on the creature so that it becomes similar to an undead creature; therefore necromancy, and abilities that drain will have no effect on a vampire. Some of the more powerful vampires even have the ability to transform into bats. Due to all of this, vampires are often classified as a different race.\n"
"\n"
"As vampires have a strong craving for blood, they usually overwhelm an already existing society mainly composed of living creatures, and build a monarchy or an oligarchy over it; the living members of the society would be subservient to the local vampires, and annually, five dozen of those members would be sacrificed to the vampire population. Due to this practice, the vampiric overlords encourage the subservient population to reproduce in great numbers so that the number of members of the subservient population remains plentiful. In return for compliance, the participating families get a somewhat higher place in society. These societies work for two reasons, one because of the threat the vampires present; two, the subservient members benefit from this setup.\n"

"Few Weavers and Prophetesses reach the rank of Ascendant. Not just because of the difficult in reaching this goal, but also because of the danger and sacrifice necessary. The path to becoming an Ascendant begins when a Weaver-born binds themselves to their accompanying spirit in the same manner that the spirit bound itself to her on her birth. A successful binding will slowly, over the course of two years, pull her body into The Raw. If the Ascending fails, she faces a slow death. As the Spirit cares for her well-being above all else, it will reject the binding unless she can convince it that she is powerful enough to Ascend. If successful, her physical form will slowly be converted into The Raw itself, granting her immortality and great, though not infallible, insight into the nature of events, both current and of those to come.\n"

msgid "Stunningly powerful warriors, Warmongers epitomise the warlike path of the Heretic. Their command of the forbidden flame cipher, as well as the bloodthirsty fury they unleash upon their opponents, make them the terror of their allies as much as of their enemies. Yet even the peaceful Windsong realise that such power must be put to use, and they are often selected to lead groups of their fellow Heretics into battle."

"While most Windsong are able to devote themselves to only one or two aspects of the cipher, there are those who are able to access many. When such a child is born, a spirit from The Raw appears and binds to them. To best make use of their gifts, these 'Weavers' (for they can intertwine their ciphers) are given the best education and training that the Council can provide.\n"

"Once they reach adulthood, Weavers fill a number of different roles in Windsong society: they are the healers, the planners, the diviners, and the military leaders. They pursue the art of archery, viewing it as a form of meditation, and are aided in both everyday life and battle by their accompanying spirit.\n"

"The first lessons a Weaver-born learns are the arts of healing, though she cannot yet cure poison."
