It is, as that king goes on to say, an ability that belongs to others as much to oneself. Such lesson is one that a flagbearer learns across the years; once he fully understand it, he finds himself surrounded by those whose hearts he's earned, whose souls have been filled with his bravery, and who have learned to become greater than they are through his example.

"In an age long forgotten by the rest of the world, when the Windsong first took up their watch, they realized that it would be impractical to carry out their duty of balancing without becoming dangerously numerous themselves. The Windsong needed servants who could become numerous in times of balancing and quickly decrease in times of hiding. Servants who could be trusted utterly, could travel quickly and were able to perform a variety of tasks. The cipher, the only power used by the Windsong, was capable of carving such servants from The Raw and binding them into reality. But this required the full attention of an Ascendant to maintain even a handful of these Shards. And so the Windsong gathered the most powerful Cryptographers (those who use ciphers) to the Foundation, and had them construct an artifact of unimaginable, though very defined, power to do it for them. It took centuries to create, but with it the Windsong were finally complete.\n"

A successful binding will slowly, over the course of two years, pull her body into The Raw. If the Ascending fails, she faces a slow death. As the Spirit cares for her well-being above all else, it will reject the binding unless she can convince it that she is powerful enough to Ascend. If successful, her physical form will slowly be converted into The Raw itself, granting her immortality and great, though not infallible, insight into the nature of events, both current and of those to come.\n"

So, for the Windsong, knowing when to act is more important. The Raw is affected by all events, both past and future, and is fluidic as these possibilities change. Through her accompanying spirit, some Weavers learn to interpret flows in The Raw as predictions for future events. With time and experience, her predictions become more accurate and dependable. Eventually, if she is of quality, she will be invited to join the ranks of the Prophets. Unlike the farseers of other peoples, the Windsong Prophetesses do not 'witness' events so much as apply an expanded form of cause and effect. Knowing all flows are open to interpretation, Prophets are discouraged from making predictions without the council of her peers.\n"

"The term 'vampire' is a word in an ancient dialect of the human language that would mean 'corrupted blood' in the modern tongue. In reality, vampires are not of a totally different race, but are the result of when a living creature's blood is corrupted by a very powerful, arcane type of magic. All vampires have red glowing eyes, white hair, pale skin, long fangs, and a craving for the blood of other living creatures. In addition, this magic has an effect on the creature so that it becomes similar to an undead creature; therefore necromancy, and abilities that drain will have no effect on a vampire. Some of the more powerful vampires even have the ability to transform into bats. Due to all of this, vampires are often classified as a different race.\n"
"\n"
"As vampires have a strong craving for blood, they usually overwhelm an already existing society mainly composed of living creatures, and build a monarchy or an oligarchy over it; the living members of the society would be subservient to the local vampires, and annually, five dozen of those members would be sacrificed to the vampire population. Due to this practice, the vampiric overlords encourage the subservient population to reproduce in great numbers so that the number of members of the subservient population remains plentiful. In return for compliance, the participating families get a somewhat higher place in society. These societies work for two reasons, one because of the threat the vampires present; two, the subservient members benefit from this setup.\n"
