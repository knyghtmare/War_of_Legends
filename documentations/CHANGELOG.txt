Overall:-
---> Reverted all changes related to project WTF!.
Project WTF! was an operation that substituted the mainline lava terrain to one that allowed Brazier Creations and units with furnacefoot movement type to walk on it, while maintaining the properties of the properties lava terrain.
But, when I tried editing the terrain graphics, I was blown away. Having tried numerous times, i give up!!!! This project will never be completed as this too complex!
