# Contributing

This is a document regarding contributions.

## Artists

If you are good at pixel artist and would like to animate some of the units, do get in touch.

## Translations

The POT file is ready and can be translated. I do not attend on adding any new content soon, so it is more or less stable in terms of content.

## Lore discussions

_War of Legends_ is set on the fantasy world of Irdya and follows the _Dark Irdya_ timeline of events. Any discussions or inquires can be answered by contacting me.

## Bug Reports

Please report any bugs here on GitHub or on the forums (preferred).

### Bugs in User-Made Content

Issues with user-made content should be reported to their respective creators on the forums. You can usually find a thread for the add-on in question in the [Scenario & Campaign Development](http://www.wesnoth.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=8), [Faction & Era Development](http://www.wesnoth.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=19) or [Multiplayer Development](http://www.wesnoth.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=15) sections.

### Information to Include

We have several issue templates to choose from when opening a bug report. Please choose the one that best fits the bug. You do not need to include everything (we don't need screenshots for a compiling issue, for example), but the more information you can provide, the better. We need at least enough information to replicate the bug before we can track down the root cause.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests (PRs) can be created by forking the repository on the github website, making your own changes to your forked repository, and then clicking the "Pull request" button.  All pull requests must follow the above guidelines in order to be merged and whenever possible should include additional unit tests in order to both prove the proposed fix or feature works as intended as well as to allow quickly detecting other bugs in that area of code the future. It is also highly recommended to use an editor that at least support syntax highlighting (such as VSCode or Notepad++) regardless of what you're changing - just because you _can_ edit files through the github website or with plain Notepad does not mean you _should_.

One additional thing I would like to mention is that you really do not need to make any PR's since reporting it as an issue or on the Forums, usually gets my attention for it to be patched.
