Many elements of this campaign differ from standard Wesnoth. If you aren’t sure if I’ve implemented something differently, look here; this should explain.

<b>Tips:</b>
• Read the objectives — there may be special win conditions.
• Don’t try to eradicate all enemies — they may be respawning.
• Explore — there may be hidden areas.

<b>NOTE:</b> A game screen resolution of 800x600 or greater is recommended. Additionally, some sequences make use of floating labels, halos, and standing unit animations, so you might want to make sure these options are enabled under Preferences → Display.]]

Units with magical abilities (such as Elynia and Niryone) are able to cast spells. Each has a list of spells they have learned, accessible from the <i>"Spells"</i> right click menu.

<b>To cast a spell:</b>
• Right click on any unit who has learned spells and select the <i>“Spells”</i> option.
• Select a spell and click “Cast Spell”. This will create an overlay over any valid potential targets for that spell
• Right click on any of these highlighted hexes and select the <i>“Cast Spell: (spell name)”</i> option.

<b>NOTE:</b> Some spells may have limited usage or cooldown time, so be sure to use them wisely.]]
