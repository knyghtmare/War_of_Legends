    description= _ "The Kalkunids were unique of all species absorbed by the Steelhive in that they seemed to have some degree of natural resistance to the Metallizing Virus due to their genetic potential. Among certain individuals of the race, the Virus would simply not hold long enough. Among other individuals of the race, the Virus's metallizing properties would be driven wild, creating an imperfect evolution with little self-control, knowing only an unabating hunger."
