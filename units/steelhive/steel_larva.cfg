    description= _ "The most basic form of Steelhive conversion, Steel Larvae are freshly assimilated organisms still adapting to their metallic transformation. Their chitinous exoskeletons gleam with industrial precision, while primitive optical sensors flicker as they process new sensory data. Though individually weak, these creatures serve as the collective's scouts and initial colonizers, their simple programming focused on locating suitable biomass for further conversion and expansion."
