    description= _ "The Seliss of Borassol II were unique in that, rather than the Steelhive coming to them, they came to the Steelhive. One of the rare species which achieved meaningful extra-atmospheric excursion, the Seliss had their eyes set on interstellar conquest. Unfortunately for them, picking Sciruss IV at a point when the Retinari had just been completely subjugated was a rather poor choice on their part."
