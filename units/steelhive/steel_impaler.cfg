One of the rare species which achieved meaningful extraatmospheric excursion, the Seliss had their eyes set on interstellar conquest. Unfortunately for them, picking Sciruss IV at a point when the Retinari had just been completely subjugated was a rather poor choice on their part."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_FIRSTSTRIKE}
