    description= _ "Goblin Cutthroats have mastered a very unusual weapon, the sickle, which is normally only used by poor peasants, who can't afford real weapons. The Goblin Cutthroats have developed a new technique of fighting from the back of a wolf. Similar to the human riders, they rush to their enemies very fast, and then use the impetus of their wolves, to harm their enemies very hard with their sickle, sometimes even cutting off entire limbs. As wolves are by far more agile than normal horses it allows them to strike more often.

Their net has also changed in its use. Instead of slowing their enemies to flee, these formidable opponents slow their enemies to steal their gold. The Goblin Cutthroats cut the purse of their enemy. "
