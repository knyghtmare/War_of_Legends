    description= _ "Only the best of rousers can hope to become a trumpeter. Trumpeters spend many hours studying the subtleties of the complex orc war signals. For the orcs, such signals are much more than a simple message of advance or retreat, they inspire their entire army and reinforce their bloodthirsty nature. Many orc warlords consider their trumpeter a trusted confidante and sometimes a trumpeter may be allowed to consult with the warlord on his battle plan."
