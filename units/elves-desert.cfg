    description= _ "Having adapted to the harsh climate of the barren deserts, these elves have long forgotten their previous home of the evergreen forests. Unlike their forest counterparts, most of their troops have dropped the bow in favour of either the bolas or the shield. The bow is still used by their archers, but they lack the accuracy of their ancestors."
