    description=_ "King Dowrein I, Memoirs of a mercenary:
'I have experienced this scene a hundred times, as one merchant caravan or another wound its way along the verge of the deep woods: the quiet conversations of the wagoneers, the soldiers boastfully narrating their exploits of the day before, then the sudden anxiety of the horses, their fearful whinnying and rearing. Wagons and men alike stopped, all eyes and hears searching for the smallest sign. And then, the sudden, brutal attack of those demonic creatures.

But though with time and hard-won experience we became skilled at driving them back to that cursed forest, our fear remained the same with each battle: the fear of losing our minds and souls, and ultimately, our lives.'"
