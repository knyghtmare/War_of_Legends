    description= _"The Deep Elves are descendants of the original wood-elves of the forest of Lintanir, the great grove in the northwest of the Great Continent. Being nothing more than just shadows of their former selves, the Deep Elves reside in the caverns of Blackqvasten, a place hidden underneath the heart of the Great Continent where neither the dead nor the living can see. At the lowest point of Blackqvasten lies the Black Lake, where a statue of Shassagoth stands. Shassagoth, often depicted as a huge black dragon, directs the Deep Elves from his shadow realm. They serve him loyally and unquestioningly, and he, in turn, smites their foes.

In the darkness of the depths, the former elves made a pact with Shassagoth and transformed. Some gained a skin as bright as the stars, a skin which could render blades and arrows harmless. These elves are called Lightborn. They retain their faerie nature, illuminating the dark caverns with their mere presence. Others evolved a skin as dark as the night, granting them shelter in the darkest realms and allowing them to merge with the shadows, quickly moving through the nights. Still others developed a skin as red as blood, reflecting the crimson liquid spilled in battle, as a sign of their remarkable powers in blade or magic. Despite their distinguishing characteristics, the pact that the Deep Elves made with Shassagoth unifies them all. And what once was elf has now become a tool of darkness.

The followers of the depths create statues of Shassagoth throughout the vast plains of the Great Continent as monuments to expand his influence. Now, scores of statues of Shassagoth have been established, even in the most remote regions. Their stone eyes watch and wait, biding their time until the darkness once again covers the lands."
