    description= _ "Dwarven Rune Healers are skilled practitioners who inscribe complex healing sigils and prepare potent elixirs from rare crystalline minerals. Bearing responsibility for preserving ancient formulae, they often serve as valued advisors to clan elders. Their presence outside the stronghold indicates a crisis requiring their expertise or a mission to recover lost lore from forgotten dwarven halls."
