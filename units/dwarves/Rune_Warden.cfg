    description= _ "Sages of Dwarfdom are masters of runic healing whose knowledge serves as living archives of clan history and lore. A single touch of their potent runes can even close lethal wounds and cure deadly ailments. When one emerges from the depths of mountains, it signals reasons of utmost gravity or matters that threaten dwarvenkind itself, and a loss of their kind, if it ever happens, is considered as an irreparable blow to their core."
