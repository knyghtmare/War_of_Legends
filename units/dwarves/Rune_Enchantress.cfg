    description= _ "Dwarf Rune Enchantresses wield symbols of power that shatter stone and reshape battlefields, inscribing glowing runes directly upon the air itself. They command respect even from magic-skeptical warriors, for their art remains grounded in dwarven principles—painstaking precision rather than mercurial spellweaving. Some serve as war-counselors while others recover ancient weapons etched with runes whose meanings have been lost to time."
