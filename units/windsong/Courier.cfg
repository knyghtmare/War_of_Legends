    description= _ "Unlike other humans and many other races, the Windsong possess neither domesticated beasts of burden, nor mechanical transports â€” the former due to the icy conditions of their homeland, and the latter due to their distaste for machines. Instead, some girls devote themselves to learning the levitation ciphers. There are many benefits to this. Rough terrain possesses little impediment, as do ice and water, and delicate loads can be carried quickly. However, their devotion to levitation denies them access to the more offensive ciphers. Instead, they tend to carry sharpned rocks and hit their opponents with them if they come too close. Their skill at manipulating gravity makes their long distance attacks uncannily accurate."
