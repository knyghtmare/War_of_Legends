    description= _ "The records concerning the master Reavers for whom the title of Dreadnought was created tell not only of their heroic deeds in battle, of the courage with which they hurled themselves against hordes of foes — but also of their darker deeds, of cities razed to the ground and of armies laid to waste before their unstoppable advance. Legends long since forgotten by all but the Windsong themselves, the revival of their order heralds that new ones will soon be written."
