    description= _ "While most Windsong are able to devote themselves to only one or two aspects of the cipher, there are those who are able to access many. When such a child is born, a spirit from The Raw appears and binds to them. To best make use of their gifts, these 'Weavers' (for they can intertwine their ciphers) are given the best education and training that the Council can provide.

Once they reach adulthood, Weavers fill a number of different roles in Windsong society: they are the healers, the planners, the diviners, and the military leaders. They pursue the art of archery, viewing it as a form of meditation, and are aided in both everyday life and battle by their accompanying spirit.

The first lessons a Weaver-born learns are the arts of healing, though she cannot yet cure poison."
