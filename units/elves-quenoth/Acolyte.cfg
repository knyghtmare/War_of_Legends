    description= _ "Faerie and elven magic have oft been aptly associated with life, from which they draw the majority of their power. However, with the death of much of Irdya’s flora, the Quenoth Elves were forced to seek another source for their sorcery. In time, they learned to harness the power of the suns Sela and Naia - the twin stars that had razed the forests of Irdya to ashes, yet still spring forth the energy required for sparking life. Those who master this new magic sing of the dual nature of these embodiments of fire: flames that are both life and life’s demise."
