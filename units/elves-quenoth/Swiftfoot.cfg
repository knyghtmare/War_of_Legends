    description= _ "In the harsh desert, agility and resourcefulness are key to survival. The Quenoth Swiftfoot embodies these traits, moving swiftly across the sands to outmaneuver their foes. Equipped with light weapons fashioned from the limited resources of their arid homeland, they rely on speed and cunning to gain the upper hand in combat. Their footsteps leave no trace, and their strikes are as swift and precise as the desert winds."
