    description= _ "Centaurs are half-human, half-horse beings who roam the wilderness between forest and plain. These proud warriors form strong bonds with those who share their reverence for nature's balanceâ€”the stalwart Minotaurs and cunning Gnolls who fight alongside them, as well as the forest-dwelling elves and faeries they often protect. Swift across open ground and nimble through woodland paths, centaurs struggle in the confines of caves and the alien landscape of fungal caverns, where their equine heritage becomes a hindrance rather than an advantage."
