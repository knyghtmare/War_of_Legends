    description= _ "It is commonly believed that drakes cannot channel magic in a controlled way. Their innate magic is the source of their fire-breathing ability and sustains their life force. However, through the use of specially crafted staves enchanted with sylph tears, certain drakes have learned to harness their inner magic. These staves enable them to cast frost bolts and project a magical aura that grants resistance to most forms of magic. This development has led to the creation of a fifth caste within drake society: the Caster Caste. An unusual characteristic of this caste is that all its members are female drakes."
