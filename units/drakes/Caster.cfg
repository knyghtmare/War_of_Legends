    description= _ "Having mastered the basics of magical manipulation through their enchanted staves, Drake Casters have earned respect within the newly formed fifth caste. Their proficiency with frost magic has grown considerably, allowing them to weave more complex spells and maintain stronger protective auras. The sylph tears embedded in their staves resonate more deeply with their inner fire, creating a unique harmony between opposing elements. These experienced magic-wielders serve as both warriors and teachers, passing their knowledge to younger apprentices while defending drake territories with deadly precision."
