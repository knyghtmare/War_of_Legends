    description=_"While humans must devote considerable time and concentration to learning the magical arts, those elves with the most magical aptitude are often those that spend the least time training magical skills. Elvish mages are dilettantes who spend their waking hours practicing fencing, art, music, and other non-magical pursuits, cultivating a broad worldview which nurtures their innate intuition for magic.

This approach, so radically different from that of humans and their rigidly regimented schools of magi, often leads human observers to misinterpret the place of elvish mages in their society. Their seemingly idle lifestyles coupled with the positions of esteem afforded to individuals of such intelligence and wisdom often lead humans to brand these mages as 'nobles' after their own idiom."
