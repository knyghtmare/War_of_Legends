    description= _ "Young centaurs who patrol the borderlands between civilization and wilderness. Armed with sturdy spears and natural agility, Wardens serve as the first line of defense for their herds. Their keen eyes and swift hooves make them excellent scouts, able to traverse vast distances across plains and through forests with remarkable speed. Though inexperienced in the greater conflicts of the world, their fierce loyalty and natural fighting instincts make them formidable opponents to any who threaten their territory."
