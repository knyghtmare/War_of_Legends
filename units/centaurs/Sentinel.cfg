    description= _ "Seasoned guardians who have proven themselves in countless skirmishes, Sentinels command respect among their people. Their spears have tasted the blood of many foes, and their tactical wisdom guides younger warriors in battle. These veterans possess an intimate knowledge of forest paths and prairie winds, using terrain to their advantage with deadly efficiency. A Sentinel's presence on the battlefield inspires confidence in allies and strikes fear into enemies who underestimate the reach of centaur steel."
