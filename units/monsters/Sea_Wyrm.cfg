    description= _ "The sea wyrm is a mythical creature that dwells in the depths of the ocean. It has a long, serpentine body covered in shimmering scales that reflect the colors of the sea. Its head is adorned with sharp, curved horns and its eyes glow with an otherworldly light. The sea wyrm is a fearsome predator, capable of swallowing ships whole and dragging sailors down into the abyss. Despite its ferocity, the sea wyrm is also revered by some cultures as a symbol of power and wisdom, and its image is often depicted in art and mythology."
