    description= _ "The great sea dragon is a massive creature that dominates the depths of the ocean. Its body is covered in shimmering scales that reflect the colors of the sea, and it has two clawed fore legs and two clawed hind legs that propel it through the water with incredible speed. Its jaws are lined with razor-sharp teeth, and its bite is powerful enough to crush even the strongest of ships. Despite its fearsome reputation, the great sea dragon is also revered by some cultures as a symbol of strength and resilience, and its image is often depicted in art and mythology."
