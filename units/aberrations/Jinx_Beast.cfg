    description= _ "Sage Hogene, excerpt from a conversation with Lieutenant Artingale:
'- My Lord, I have divined the nature of those beasts' capacity. There is no curse, it is only a mind trick.
- What do you mean, Hogene? Facts prove you wrong, the men are clearly struck by misfortune. Look at them struggle to fight: they seem unable to parry the simplest blow as soon as they meet the damned creatures.
- They are under the effects of some sort of hypnosis, Lieutenant. They are self-deluded into their own misfortune. The men themselves are responsible of their own clumsiness! Fortunately, I have found a way to dispel the clouds in their minds, and restore their ability to fight.'"
