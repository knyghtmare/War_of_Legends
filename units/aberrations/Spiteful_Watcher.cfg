    description= _ "Silver Mage Norsesh, Arcane Interactions - Analysis and Theorisation:
'Intriguingly, the mental focus necessary to achieve substantial arcane effects is not without its liabilities. I hypothesize that the channels we develop in our minds are somehow accessible by certain external forces. The case of the Spiteful Watcher, an arcane creation to be found (at great peril to the finder) in southern Wesnoth, supports this hypothesis. These large, aggressive Watchers possess mental attacks that are especially dangerous for mages.'"
