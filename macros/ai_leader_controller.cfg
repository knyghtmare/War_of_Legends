# The main macro is AI_CONTROLLER_ALLOW_MOVEMENT_CONTROL ID SIDE.
# It allows you to order a leader to move to a specifc hex. It will then STAY there--at
# least until the end of the turn. (The mainline macro allows the leader to continue to
# a different hex after arriving.) This macro also allows the player to order the leader
# not to move at all. Both actions are visible: There is an X marking the movement
# target, and mousing over a frozen leader shows that they can't move.

# This doesn't integrate well with the current, mainline control macros, but it could be
# added as a separate macro. (It could replace one of the current ones.)
